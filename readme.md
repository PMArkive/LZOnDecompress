NO SUPPORT PROVIDED. Feel free to report bugs though.

## LZOn reference

0x00: Magic "LZOn"
0x04: Magic 0x00,0x2F,0xF1,0x71 (presumably)
0x08: Size of decompressed file (32-bit, big endian)
0x0C: Size of compressed file minus 0x11 (32-bit big endian)
0x10: LZO compressed data stream (follows [https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/lzo.txt]). Note that 16-bit values in the LZO stream are little endian.

Output generated by decompressing the LZO data stream and then padding to the decompressed file size specified in the header with 0x00 bytes.
